# 18.330: Introduction to numerical analysis

## Spring 2020

Welcome to 18.330! This is an introductory course on numerical analysis.

We will be using the [Julia language](www.julialang.org). Please follow [these installation instructions](installation.md).

## Logistics

- Visiting professor David P. Sanders ([sandersd@mit.edu](mailto:sandersd@mit.edu))

- MWF 1--2, room 2-139.

- Office hours:

  - Mon 5.20-6.20 in the **Julia lab**, 7th floor of Stata Center (turn left from Gates building elevator)
  - Tues 5-6 in the Julia lab
  - Thurs 5-6 in 2.332

- Piazza forum: https://piazza.com/class/k65ke8eo9x760n

### Slides, notebooks and recordings from lectures

- Slides and notebooks for each lecture are available in the [lectures](lectures) directory.

- Screen recordings of lectures are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ubkqwrqxnukgllc/AAA2cH9r7YQL7WmYVt-bblxta?dl=0)

- Summaries of each lecture are [here](summaries.md)

### Evaluation

- 9 problem sets (66.6%). No late submissions, but the lowest score will be dropped.
<!-- - 1 midterm exam (20%): Wednesday, March 18 -->
- Final project (33.4%): Due Tuesday, May 12

Problem sets will consist of a mixture of theory and coding. They will be submitted and graded online.

The final project will be an exploration of a topic in numerical analysis that we have not covered in class (although at the level of the class), and will include a discussion of the mathematics behind the method, together with your own implementation.

### Learning Julia

- Prof. Steven Johnson will give an introduction to Julia on Friday, Feb 7 from 5-7pm in 32-141. Make sure to install Julia beforehand. See https://github.com/mitmath/julia-mit for information and resources on Julia.

- For help with Julia you should be able to find people in the Julia lab most of the time (see above for directions)

- More learning resources are available at https://julialang.org/learning/

### Windows users

If you use Windows, please download Git for Windows [here](https://gitforwindows.org)

### Getting the files

To get the files, use `git` from the command line (or from a GUI), as follows

- Clone the repository once with
```
git clone https://github.com/mitmath/18330
```
This will create a new directory called `18330` with the matierials.


- Update it to pull in new changes each time with
```
git pull
```
This needs to be executed from within the directory. (Use `cd` to change directory.)
